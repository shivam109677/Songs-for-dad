Python-based tool to batch-download Bollywood songs as MP3s from YouTube using yt-dlp and ffmpeg. Built for offline car listening.
# Information
This project is a Python-based automation tool designed to download Bollywood songs in MP3 format directly from YouTube using yt-dlp and ffmpeg.

Originally created to help my father enjoy his favorite old Hindi songs in the car without needing internet or streaming apps, this script takes a list of song titles, searches for the best YouTube matches, downloads them in bulk, and converts them into high-quality MP3s — all automatically.

It’s a simple but meaningful solution for anyone who wants offline access to classic music without the manual hassle.
